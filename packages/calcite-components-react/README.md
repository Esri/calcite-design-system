# Calcite Components React

A set of React components that wrap [Calcite Components](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/). An application using this package is provided in the [`calcite-components-examples`](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-components-examples) repo.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save @esri/calcite-components-react
```

This package includes the compatible version of the main component library as a dependency, so no need to install `@esri/calcite-components` separately.

## Choose a build

There are two builds that are provided by the standard `calcite-components` package.

### Custom Elements build

[Custom Elements](developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/get-started#custom-elements) is the recommended build when using frontend frameworks, such as React. To use this build, you will need to set the path to the `calcite-components` assets. You can either use local assets, which will be explained in a subsequent step, or assets hosted on a CDN.

```jsx
import { setAssetPath } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components";
// Local assets
setAssetPath(window.location.href);

// CDN hosted assets
// setAssetPath("https://unpkg.com/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets");
```

Next, you need to import each component you use from the standard `calcite-component` package's custom elements build. This will automatically define the custom elements on the window. Then import the same components from `calcite-components-react`.

```jsx
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-button";
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-icon";
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-slider";
import { CalciteButton, CalciteIcon, CalciteSlider } from "@esri/calcite-components-react";
```

### Dist build

When using the [Dist](developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/get-started#distribution) build, you'll need to manually define the custom elements on the window. You can also choose between local and CDN hosted assets.

```jsx
import { defineCustomElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";
// Local assets
defineCustomElements(window);

// CDN hosted assets
// defineCustomElements(window, {
//   resourcesUrl: "https://unpkg.com/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets"
// });
```

Since you manually defined the custom elements on the window, you only need to import the individual components from `calcite-components-react`.

```jsx
import { CalciteButton, CalciteIcon, CalciteSlider } from "@esri/calcite-components-react";
```

## Import stylesheet

Import the global stylesheet into your app (only do this once):

```js
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/calcite.css";
```

## Copy Assets

Some components (icon, date-picker) rely on assets being available at a particular path. If using assets locally, you'll need to copy these over to your public folder. Something like:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/* ./public/assets/
```

## Why not just use the web components directly?

Because React uses a synthetic event system, the custom events emitted from calcite components won't work with JSX in React. For example, say you want to update some value when the `calcite-slider` component changes. When using the standard web components, you need to save a ref to the element, and add a listener:

```jsx
const sliderEl = useRef(null);
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);

function onUpdate(event) {
  setSliderValue(event.target.value);
}

// need to access the dom node to set custom event listeners for props that aren't strings / numbers
// lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react#why-are-wrappers-needed
useEffect(
  (_) => {
    sliderEl.current.addEventListener("calciteSliderUpdate", onUpdate);
  },
  [sliderEl],
);
```

Using `calcite-components-react`, these events are connected for you:

```jsx
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);
<CalciteSlider onCalciteSliderUpdate={(e) => setSliderValue(e.target.value)} />;
```

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also get increased type safety for your event listeners, props, etc.
