# Calcite Components React

This package provides React wrappers for [Calcite components](https://developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/components/). Refer to the [React example](https://github.com/Esri/calcite-design-system/tree/dev/examples/components/react) for a minimal application using this package.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @esri/calcite-components-react
```

This package includes the compatible version of the standard `@esri/calcite-components` package, so you do not need to install it separately.

## Choose a build

There are two builds provided by the standard components package.

### Custom Elements build

[Custom Elements](developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/get-started#custom-elements) is the recommended build when using frontend frameworks, such as React. Assets from the CDN are used by default, but you can specify a local asset path with `setAssetPath`. Additional setup for using local assets will be explained in a subsequent step.

```jsx
import { setAssetPath } from "@esri/calcite-components";

setAssetPath(window.location.href);
```

Next, you need to import each component you use from the standard components package's custom elements build. This will automatically define the custom elements on the window. Then, import the same components from `@esri/calcite-components-react`.

```jsx
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-button";
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-icon";
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/components/calcite-slider";
import { CalciteButton, CalciteIcon, CalciteSlider } from "@esri/calcite-components-react";
```

### Dist build

When using the [Dist](developers.arcgis.com/calcite-design-system/get-started#distribution) build, you'll need to manually define the custom elements on the window:

```jsx
import { defineCustomElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";

defineCustomElements();
```

Since you manually defined the custom elements on the window, you only need to import the individual components from `@esri/calcite-components-react`.

```jsx
import { CalciteButton, CalciteIcon, CalciteSlider } from "@esri/calcite-components-react";
```

## Import stylesheet

Import the global stylesheet into your app (only do this once):

```js
import "@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/calcite.css";
```

## Copy Assets

Some components (icon, date-picker) rely on assets being available at a particular path. If using assets locally, you'll need to copy these over to your public folder. Something like:

```sh
cp -r node_modules/@esri/calcite-components/dist/calcite/assets/* ./public/assets/
```

## Why not just use the web components directly?

Because React uses a synthetic event system, the custom events emitted from Calcite components won't work with JSX in React. For example, say you want to update some value when the `calcite-slider` component changes. When using the standard web components, you need to save a ref to the element, and add a listener:

```jsx
const sliderEl = useRef(null);
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);

function onUpdate(event) {
  setSliderValue(event.target.value);
}

// need to access the DOM node to set custom event listeners for props that aren't strings or numbers
// lit.dev/docs/frameworks/react#why-are-wrappers-needed
useEffect(
  (_) => {
    sliderEl.current.addEventListener("calciteSliderUpdate", onUpdate);
  },
  [sliderEl],
);
```

Using `@esri/calcite-components-react`, these events are connected for you:

```jsx
const [sliderValue, setSliderValue] = useState(50);
<CalciteSlider onCalciteSliderUpdate={(e) => setSliderValue(e.target.value)} />;
```

If you're using TypeScript, you'll also get increased type safety for your event listeners, props, etc.
