# @esri/eslint-plugin-calcite-components

ESLint rules specific to Stencil JS projects.

## Installation

Install the following deps in your stencil project:

```bash
npm i @esri/eslint-plugin-calcite-components --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add or update the `.eslintrc.json` configuration file:

```json
{
  "parserOptions": {
    "project": "./tsconfig.json"
  },
  "extends": ["plugin:@esri/calcite-components/recommended"]
}
```

Add a new `lint` script to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint src/**/*{.ts,.tsx}"
  }
}
```

Then you can run the linter:

```shell
npm run lint
```

## Supported Rules

- [`@esri/calcite-components/ban-events`](./docs/ban-events.md)

This rule helps prevent usage of specific events and allows suggesting alternatives.

- [`@esri/calcite-components/no-dynamic-createelement`](./docs/no-dynamic-createelement.md)

This rule ensures that calls to `document.createElement()` use string literals to avoid dynamic tag creation to enhance plugin compatibility.

- [`@esri/calcite-components/strict-boolean-attributes`](./docs/strict-boolean-attributes.md)

This rule catches boolean props that are initialized in a way that does not conform to the HTML5 spec.
