# require-event-emitter-type

**Deprecated** This rule is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Event typing has been improved and is no longer needed.

This rule helps enforce the payload type to `EventEmitter`s to avoid misleading `any` type on the `CustomEvent` detail object.

## Config

No config is needed

## Usage

```json
{ "@esri/calcite-components/require-event-emitter-type": "error" }
```
