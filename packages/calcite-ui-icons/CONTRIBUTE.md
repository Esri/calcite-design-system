# Contributing to calcite-ui-icons

The creative lab is the main contributor as they provide the various icons used by the different apps.

## Bugs

Create an issue that describes clearly the issue and the reproducible steps.

## Pull Requests

If you feel the urge to contribute, submit your updates with pull request.

## Running the Doc Site

First install all dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Next, run the server:

```sh
npm run server
```

This will optimize the icons, create a JSON file with all the icon path data, and start up a development server with live reload capabilities.

This task also watches for changes and rebuilds the JSON file whenever icons are added or edited, automatically reloading your browser to display changes as they come in.
